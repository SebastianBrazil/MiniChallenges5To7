MiniChallenge 5 to 7 Endpoints

This project has four endpoints. The first is based of the MadLibs mini challenge. The second takes an inputted number and determines if it is odd or even. The third takes a phrase and reverses the letters and numbers. The fourth takes only a number sequence and reverses the numbers.

1/10/24: Created and built out the project.

All of the minichallenges work, however its unclear what the user should enter into the madlib parameters. I suggest you name the parameter after what you want to go in there, such as enterNoun or enterVerb. Other than that all the challenges work on swagger and postman. The number reverse it and odd or even both have data validation. While the pull works, I suggest you use a get. I don't know if you need too but I would go ask a TA if its ok to use pull and not get docked points. overall good job
